# ESX-1-proteins
The ESX-1 Proteins Repository contains various R code files related to the ESX-1 proteins (espb, espk, esxA, esxB, phoR, phoP and espR. These code files provide examples and snippets in R programming language, demonstrating the extraction process of residues with a buried surface area score greater than 0 from the XML dataset.

By utilizing the code snippet, we can calculate the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and extract residues that have more than zero SNPs within the protein interactions. This snippet illustrates how to retrieve observed mutations within the genes.

Furthermore, the code snippet guides the extraction of relevant information from the XML file, such as the buried surface area score, solvent accessible area, solvation energy, binding type (hydrogen or salt), and other relevant data. These details are crucial for merging the necessary information from both proteins involved in the interaction, enabling an analysis of the impact of SNPs on their conservation.

Additionally, within the ESX-1 Proteins Repository, boxplots are provided for each interaction, offering visual representations of the relevant data and aiding in further analysis and interpretation.
